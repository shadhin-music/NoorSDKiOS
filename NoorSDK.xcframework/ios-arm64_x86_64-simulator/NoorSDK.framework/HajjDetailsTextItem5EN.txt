Pilgrims return to the Jamaraat bridge in Mina for the ritual Stoning of the Devil. They throw pebbles at the largest of three consecutive columns representing the Devil. This day, the 10th day of DhulHijjah, is also Eidul-Adha for Muslims around the world. The day is marked by sacrificing livestock and sharing the meat with family and the poor.
